                      the Agreement.
                    </p>

                      reservation for the hotel chosen by the Tourist will be

                      the booking confirmation. Failure to confirm the
                      reservation, the signed Agreement for accommodation in a

                      new contract. If the Tourist refuses to enter into a new
